          <p>Hey,</p>
          <p>I'm note entirely sure why there is an about page on a weatherapp, but I'll use this page to talk a little bit about what this project is meant to showcase.</p>
          <p>Of course every site that is built is a demonstration of CSS and HTML. This site is fully responsive. This time I to style it for mobile viewing first then desktops. I think this was maybe slightly easier as a smaller layout doesn't look as wonky on a larger screen as the opposite does.</p>
          <p>In addtion, I got to practice a bit more with collapsible nav menus and animations. I also dug up a neat, and most importantly, simple trick to freeze the background page from scrolling when the nav menu is up by using <code>html {overflow-y: hidden}.</code></p>
          <p>This was also my first go-round with CSS grid layout which is a little tricky to wrap your head around at times, but extremely powerful. Honestly this made make everything responsive signficantly easier than my previous endeavors.</p>
          <p>I also got practice creating dynamic html elements and manipulating the DOM using javascript. It was quite a bit of code, more tedious than anything. But I learned to make utility functions to make DOM element creation more efficient. e.g. my use of functions to replace <code>document.querySelector()</code> and <code>document.createElement</code>. Just abstracting these two basic functions into shorter calls reduced my work a ton!</p>
          <p>On the javascript side of things this was a great way to practice asyncronous javascript using async/await, API calls, and working with <abbr title='Javascript Objection Notation'>JSON</abbr>. There's little to be said about this aspect of the code though because it was relatively straight forward: fetch data, extract data, plug it in. <em>Template literals</em> made this so easy as well; old school string formatting would've been far more clunky and just bleh...</p>
          <p>Before I push this onto github for good, I'm also going to need to use gitignore to store my API key elsewhere and then wright a proper readme for folks looking to use it. This way I can practice more with github and with documenting my work!</p>
